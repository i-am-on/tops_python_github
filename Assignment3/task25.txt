Or What Is A Constructor In Python?

- Inheritance: The object of one class can aquire the properties of object of another class is called inheritance or creating a new class from existing class is called inheritance.

- In Python, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created.
The purpose of a python constructor is to assign values to the data members within the
class when an object is initialized. The name of the constructor method is always __init__.


Example: 

class A:
    def getA(self,a):
        self.a=a
    def putA(self):
        print("A : ",self.a)

class B(A):
    def getB(self,b):
        self.b=b
    def putB(self):
        print("B : ",self.b)


b=B()
b.getA(10)
b.getB(20)
b.putA()
b.putB()
