task-13. Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

Ans. Exception handling in Python is a process of resolving errors that occur in a program. This involves catching exceptions, understanding what caused them, and then responding accordingly. Exceptions are errors that occur at runtime when the program is being executed.

- An error is an issue in a program that prevents the program from completing its task. In comparison, an exception is a condition that interrupts the normal flow of the program. Both errors and exceptions are a type of runtime error, which means they occur during the execution of a program.

-The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

-The except block lets you handle the error.

-The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
